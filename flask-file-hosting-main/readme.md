> ### Setup
> - Download the code as a ZIP.
> - Install all the required Python libraries.
> - Run `app.py`.
> - Server is now running on `localhost`.

> ### Security
> - Files stored on this app are secured behind a password.
> - By default, the password is `securepassword` and will be asked to change when logging in.
> - All routes can only be accessed if the user has previously logged in on the same computer.
> - You may also notice that the username isnt changable, that is because you only need a password to log in.
